# OOPS-Last minute revision notesâœ…

**Object oriented programming** enhances the readibility and maintainability of the code.In OOPS the whole code revolves around objects and classes.

# Class
blueprint or template on behalf of which object can be created

# Object
instance of the class

For eg:
class hai=fruits toh object hoga =apple,mango,banana method hoga =eat,wash,cut(these methods are basically the functions)  attribute hoga=taste ,color

**A class can exist without an object, but an object cannot exist without a class.**
